# Todo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

## Angular Notes

### Using form
- Need to import `ReactiveFormsModule` in the component file that use [formControl] directive in template

### Studies
- [ ] IndexedDB
- [ ] Redux
- [ ] Animation
- [x] Routing

### Form vaildations

- 2 appraoches
    - Template based -> like `v-model` in Vue
        - Asynchorous data flow
        - Mutable 2-way bindings properties
        - Less efficient in chagne detection and tracking, poor rendering performance
        - Harder to test as rendering and passage of time included
    - Reactive form based
        - Synchoruous data flow, more safe
        - Functional paradigm, immutable data
        - Better rendering performance
        - Test is straight forward
